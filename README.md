# Travel survey tool demo

Built with R and [Shiny](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny) for the course SPT-E4010 Transport Modelling at [Aalto University](https://aalto.fi), spring  term 2019.

**Please note** that this is currently only a "proof of concept" version. The source code is not properly documented and commented, many features work in a suboptimal manner and some essential features are not implemented at all (at least yet). However, feel free to explore the app and the source code for learning purposes as I did.

A functioning example can be found on my [Shinyapps site](https://keripukki.shinyapps.io/travelsurveydemo). If the app does not work, it might well be that the monthly hour limit of my free-tier plan is full.
